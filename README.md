# clothingrepo

A website that combines clothing, accessories, and other items sold on second-hand merchant sites together. 

Currently, code is about halfway done and is able to pull individual search results given the search link. For example, upon putting in the link in ebay.py, the code will display the top search results on ebay. In the future, we will work to integrate ebay.py, grailed.py, together. 

Packages used:
    - import requests
    - from bs4 import beautifulsoup
    - pandas

Indivudual files and uses:
"- ebay.py  
    - takes a ebay search link and converts python data into a readable csv file. 
"- pictures.py
    - takes a link of image, creates and opens a file, and drops the image inside of the file. 
"- ryangudemo.py
    - asks user how many cities they would like to compare. Takes user input, displays weather data.
"- savedcode.py 
    - uses api to extract covid data from countries and creates an organized table in alphabetical order. 
    

Updates: 2/13/2023
Choudhury's code so far can pull covid cases from the internet as well as deaths. Gu's code asks for user input and pulls weather data. Have not worked with clothing yet as we are still learning how to use website API 
*testing a commit from vs code for the readme
